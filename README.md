## Workshop Framing

### Scenario Description

Congratulations! It's your first day as an intern for the Research Center.

A researcher wants to perform a retrospective cohort study to assess the risk of heart failure following exposure to one of two drugs. As the analyst, you're tasked with creating the analytic dataset and performing the analysis described in the provided [Analysis Request Form](slides/Mock_Request_Form-Python_HOW-WUSS2024.pdf).

This will include the following steps:
* Importing, exploring, and cleaning raw data
* Combining and manipulating datasets to create variables for analysis
* Statistical analysis, table creation, and output delivery

Along the way, we'll also look at equivalent SAS code for context.

### Scenario Disclaimer

This scenario is completely fictional, and all data were created using the Python package [`faker`](https://pypi.org/project/Faker/).



## Setup Instructions & Prerequisites

### Accounts Needed

A Google account will be needed to interact with code examples in [https://colab.research.google.com/](https://colab.research.google.com/)

If you don't already have a Google Account, you can create one for free at [https://accounts.google.com/signup](https://accounts.google.com/signup) 


### Attendee Prerequisites

This Hands-on Workshop is aimed at SAS programmers of all skill levels, including those with no prior experience using Python or JupyterLab. The equivalent SAS code includes DATA steps and procedures like PROC EXPORT, PROC FORMAT, PROC FREQ, PROC IMPORT, PROC LOGISTIC, PROC SGPLOT, PROC SORT, PROC SQL, PROC SUMMARY, and PROC TABULATE.

We also recommend a relatively new computer with a broadband internet connection and a modern web browser.


## Learning Outcomes

After successfully completing this workshop, we will be equipped for the following:

-	Using Google Colab for Python script development.
-	Using Python for common data-analysis tasks, including importing files, exploring dataset contents, correcting data anomalies, combining datasets, saving datasets, and building statistical models.
